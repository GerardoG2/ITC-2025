# Itty Bitty Electric Company Proposal

## 📊 Overview

This project is a data analysis and modeling proposal created for the 2025 Information Technology Competition. It focuses on identifying key reliability issues in an electric utility's circuits by analyzing outage data and building predictive models to support operational decision-making.

The goal is to provide actionable insights and recommendations to reduce outage frequency and duration, using real-world metrics like SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index) and SAIFI (System Average Interruption Frequency Index).

## ⚙️ Features

- Data wrangling and cleaning using `pandas`
- Visualizations with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Logistic regression modeling with `scikit-learn`
- Business recommendations based on key circuit reliability drivers

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn
